<h2>Etymology</h2>

<p>The word <i>fox</i> comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic <i>fuhsaz</i>. This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European <i>puḱ-</i>, meaning &lsquo;thick-haired; tail&rsquo;. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct species called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_fox">kit foxes</a>. Vixen is one of very few words in modern English that retains the Middle English southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f" (i.e. northern English "fox" versus southern English "vox"). A group of foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.</p>
