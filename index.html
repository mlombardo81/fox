<strong>Overview</strong>

<p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore">omnivorous</a> mammals belonging to several genera of the family <i class="taxonomy">Canidae</i>. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).</p>

<p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus <i class="taxonomy">Vulpes</i>. Approximately another 25 current or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction">extinct</a> species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (<i class="taxonomy">Vulpes vulpes</i>) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>

<strong>Etymology</strong>

<p>The word <i>fox</i> comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic <i>fuhsaz</i>. This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European <i>puá¸±-</i>, meaning &lsquo;thick-haired; tail&rsquo;. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct species called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_fox">kit foxes</a>. Vixen is one of very few words in modern English that retains the Middle English southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f" (i.e. northern English "fox" versus southern English "vox"). A group of foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.</p>

<strong>Behaviour</strong>

<p>In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox">Arctic foxes</a>) are known to be solitary.</p>

<p>Foxes are omnivores. Their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around 1 <abbr aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr> (2.2 <abbr aria-label="pounds">lb</abbr>) of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil. While hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage">camouflage</a> themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey. Using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the prey's neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.</p>

<p>The gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog">raccoon dog</a>.</p>
