<h2>Behaviour</h2>

<p>In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox">Arctic foxes</a>) are known to be solitary.</p>

<p>Foxes are omnivores. Their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around 1 <abbr aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr> (2.2 <abbr aria-label="pounds">lb</abbr>) of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil. While hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage">camouflage</a> themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey. Using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the prey's neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.</p>

<p>The gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog">raccoon dog</a>.</p>
